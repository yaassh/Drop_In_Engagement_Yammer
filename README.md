# Drop_In_Engagement_Yammer

Investigating the drop in user engagement for a professional messaging service.

Engagement is defined as a customer having made some type of server call by interacting with the product. Any point in this chart can be interpreted as “the number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date.”  

The aim is to determine what caused the dip at the end of the observation period and recommend solutions for the problem.
